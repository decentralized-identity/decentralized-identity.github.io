                        Kaliya Young  also known as Identity Woman founded the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005 and dedicated her career to the development of user-centric identity tools and technologies. She was at the founding meeting of DIF and has been active in working groups since its inception. She co-chairs the DIF Interoperability Working Group and Co-chair the Secure Data Store working group jointly chartered with CCG.  She curates a weekly newsletter summary of all the activities going on in SSI.

                        I'm running for the steering committee because I believe that DIF needs strong strategic leadership as the industry matures. DIF must work collaboratively with its neighbors, W3C CCG, W3C Working Groups, Trust over IP, OpenID Foundation, ID2020 and others. DIF needs to build relationships with civil society organizations and technology rights organizations whose opinions about emerging technology can influence decision makers' opinions and frame new technology opportunities and dangers for the public that adopts them. If clear strategic messaging is not developed in the next year there is a real danger the technologies we have worked so hard to develop will not get adopted because of fear based conspiracy theories.
