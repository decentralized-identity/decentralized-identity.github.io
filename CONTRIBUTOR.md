## Patent Licensing

The patent mode for all code, materials, and content in this repo, and associated with  development of this initiative, are licensed under the W3C's Patent Policy, as detailed below:

1. Licensing Commitment.  Each contributor agrees to make available any of its Essential Claims, as defined in the W3C Patent Policy (available at https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), under the W3C RF licensing requirements Section 5 (https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), as if the contribution was contained in or associated with a W3C Recommendation.

2. For Exclusion.  Prior to committing any code, bug reports, pull requests, or other forms of contribution, a contributor may exclude Essential Claims from its licensing commitments under this agreement by providing written notice of that intent to DIF's Executive Director (and must received confirmation of receipt for the exclusion to have effect).  The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and published applications must include the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that the contributor wishes to exclude from the licensing commitment set forth in Section 1 of this patent policy.  If an issued patent or pending patent application that may contain Essential Claims is not set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Essential Claims shall continue to be subject to the licensing commitments under this agreement.  The Exclusion Notice for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i) the text of the filed application; or (ii) identification of the specific part(s) of the contribution whose implementation makes the excluded claim an Essential Claim.  If (ii) is chosen, the effect of the exclusion will be limited to the identified part(s) of the contribution.  DIF's Executive Director will publish Exclusion Notices.
