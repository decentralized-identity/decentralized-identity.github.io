The [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) organization (also known as **DIF**) was formed as a [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere.

Currently, DIF has a diverse, international membership, including over 300 member companies, universities, and government agencies that are collaboratively developing the broader space of decentralized identities. 

There are 9 technical working groups, 3 business interest groups, and 4 different open groups to bring together members with shared interests, common goals, and a desire to collaborate.

**<details><summary>ZK or ZKP - Zero-Knowledge Proof</summary>**
	
**Z**ero-**K**nowledge Proof or **Z**ero-**K**nowledge **P**rotocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.
